## Overview
I got into the company as an office chore. In the beginning, I did a lot of routine work and found myself asking, “What am I doing?” I realized that I needed to change. That is when I came up with creating a sales analysis with Python. I learned Java and C++ in school, but I did not know anything about Python. There were a lot of points and hiccups along the way, but I was able to complete the task by the end of my internship. After my internship, I felt a sense of satisfaction not because I completed the Project, but because I learned something new and could feel myself improving my skills.

What I learned:
* Analyzed sales data using pandas and numpy.
* Created a sales forecast using statsmodels.api with SARIMAX model.
* Controlled Microsoft Excel using Python and Visual Basic for Applications.
